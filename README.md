# StrawNaturalFrequency


For straw-tubes, the relationship between their tension and natural frequencies is needed for most tension measurement techniques.  Furthermore, recent data are in disagreement with previous treatments. 

This repository contains a [Summary Document](https://github.com/jasonbono/StrawNaturalFrequency/blob/master/writeup/StrawFrequency.pdf) that summarizes a theoretical model of the vibrational behavior straw-tubes and the model's empirical validation.
